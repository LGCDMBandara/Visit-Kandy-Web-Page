                <h1>Ambuluwawa</h1>
                <p>Ambuluwawa Tower is located in the suburbs of Gampola Town in Sri Lanka. There has been an increased popularity in recent times especially due to the breathtaking views you can experience when you climb to the top of the Ambuluwawa Tower. The 48 meters tall, cone-shaped tower houses the Stupa (Pagoda) of the Buddhist Temple. As you climb up, it has several viewing platforms for you to enjoy the stunning views. The staircase gets narrower as you go up. The spiral staircase will be a challenging one to climb if you are not comfortable with heights. It is also known for its narrow spiral staircase which some visitors find challenging to climb. It is one of the coolest places to visit in Sri Lanka if you are up for the challenge. Ambuluwawa mountain peak has a height of 3567 feet above sea level. It is located over 1000 feet above from the Gampola Town. Since there are no other mountains in the surrounding area and due to its unique location, Ambuluwawa Tower gets an undisturbed view from far away and vice versa. The tower is visible from Gampola Train Station.</p>
