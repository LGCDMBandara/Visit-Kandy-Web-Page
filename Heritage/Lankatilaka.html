                <h1>Lankathilaka Temple</h1>
                <p>The Lankatilaka Raja Maha Vihara also known as the Lankatilaka Temple or the Blue Temple, is located in Hiyarapitiya in the Udunuwara area of Kandy, Sri Lanka’s hill capital. This is one of the three famous Temples that are located near Peradeniya.The history of Lankatilaka Vihara dates back to the Gampola era and was constructed during that time under the patronage of King Buwanekabahu IV in 1344 AD. Lankatilaka is a most unique structure in itself, having been built entirely atop an uneven rock surface and rising upto a height of eighty feet. Based on inscriptions to be found on the Temple’s copper plaque, one learns that the foundation of granite was laid on the rock surface and the rest of the structure was made of bricks. Beautiful arches and sculptures enhance the thick outer walls, making this an architectural marvel of that era. There are many inscriptions in both Sinhala and Tamil languages cut into the solid rock which describe the facilities provided to the Temple and the land gifted by Kings who ruled then. </p>
