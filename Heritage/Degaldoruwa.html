                <h1>Degaldoruwa Temple</h1>
                <p>The Degaldoruwa Raja Maha Viharaya is situated in a village called Amunugama close to the city of Kandy. It is famous for the magnificent paintings that adorn its walls and one can be forgiven for losing track of time amidst these colourful examples of ancient Kandyan art. The cave itself was said to have been hollowed out of a rock which rose to a height of around 40 feet, and shelters the Shrine Room and an entrance area. The details pertaining to the construction of this Temple are found on the Degaldoruwa Tamba Sannasa. The Degaldoruwa paintings are renowned for their beauty and are also indicative of the customs and social conditions that prevailed during that era, even the clothes worn by the people of that time and the homes they lived in are vividly portrayed. In fact, the paintings show a very distinctive difference between the garments worn by those in low-country and up-country regions. These works of art were been created by team of ‘Sittara’ painters headed by Devendra Mulachari, while Devaragampola Silvatenne Unnanse was the most known painter. </p>
